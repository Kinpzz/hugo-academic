I am currently a second-year M.S. candidate in School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University. I am working at [Human Cyber Physical Intelligence Integration Lab](http://sysu-hcp.net/) under the supervision of [Prof. Guanbin Li](http://guanbinli.com/) and [Prof. Liang Lin](http://linliang.net/). Before that, I received the B.E. degree in software engineering from Sun Yat-sen University in 2018. Roughly, my research interests include deep learning and computer vision.
